Here are a few ideas , we just want to start with an ecobee 4 ui map + customer service notes 
(but in the long term create a greater tool for smoother customer assistance) 

Assume this is a disguistingly ambitious overarching idea document but for now we will centre on the ecobee 4.

Customer Service Multitool

	A) Thermostat Maps & Notes (Shows the entire UI for all thermostats) 
		a) Smart
		b) Smart SI	
		c) EMS SI
		d) ecobee 3+ (ui menu would be a version that accounts for all possible configurations) 
		+ notes that are pertient to whatever setting you're trying to work on (i.e if its test equipment ,
     add notes for optimal equipment testing equivalent to the type.)
	B) Switch UI map & Notes 
	C) Web Portal Map & Notes

2) Wiring References
	A) (compendium of different terminals and what they tend to (or do mean) with different hvac manufactorers.

3) Wifi troubleshooting
	A) Can't connect to router
	B) Can't connect to server 

4) Alexa Troubleshooting

5) CSV Checker (checks CSV's for trends i.e signs of wall drafts or high limit switch etc) -> Brian
